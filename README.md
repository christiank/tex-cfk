# tex-cfk

This is a simple look and feel for LaTeX documents. Just "\include" it and
call "\cfk" in the preamble to set everything up. Within the document
environment, you invoke "\cfktitle{}{}{}" and provide the article's name,
the author's name and the date. There's also header commands of three
levels: "\cfkone{}", "\cfktwo{}", and "\cfkthree{}". That's pretty much all
there is to it.

I dedicate this code to the public domain. You can do whatever you want with
it, really
